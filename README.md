So i had a few problems with my code. I wanted to make a Shopping list with java basically.
so the code should have reading the file from a file.txt and then load it on a arraylist.

Errors:

FileException
	at TextFile.fromFile(TextFile.java:62)
	at ShoppingList.loadLists(ShoppingList.java:16)
	at ShoppingList.<init>(ShoppingList.java:11)
	at Main.main(Main.java:13)
